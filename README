This is the very basic start to a toy language that allows you to create types
from intersecting two other types. The parser is very immature and the
language syntax itself is likely to change.

The goal is to have a dummy parser and interpreter setup to at least run
simple functions involving arithmetic, iteration, type creation and
intersection, and printing to stdout.

Examples of the current syntax can be found in ex/ . zero.st, one.st, etc
build up a progressively more complete example. hello.st is a hello world
program.
